🌍 Waste Classification with AI
Hi there! 👋 Welcome to this project, where we're tackling waste classification using the magic of Artificial Intelligence! 🧠💡 The goal here is to take images of waste and figure out whether they're Organic (like food scraps 🍎) or Recyclable (like plastic bottles 🧴). Let's dive in!

Why This Project Matters
Managing waste responsibly is one of the biggest challenges of our time. By helping machines learn how to classify waste properly, we can take a small (but meaningful!) step toward making recycling and composting smarter and more efficient.

What’s Inside?
This project walks through:

Preparing the dataset (22,500 images—thanks, Kaggle!).
Training a deep learning model to classify waste into two categories:
Organic: Think banana peels, apple cores, or that wilted lettuce. 🥬
Recyclable: Think bottles, cans, or cardboard. ♻️
Beautiful visualizations to explore the data and evaluate the results.
A future-ready plan to expand and improve. 🚀
How It Works
1️⃣ The Dataset
We’re working with 22,500 images of waste.
The images are split into two folders: TRAIN and TEST, each containing the two categories (Organic and Recyclable).
2️⃣ The Model
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) takes charge here. It looks at these waste images, learns the patterns, and figures out how to classify them.
The model’s architecture is simple but powerful:
Layers of convolutions to learn features.
Fully connected layers for making predictions.
3️⃣ Visual Insights
We don’t just train a model; we look at the data and results in style:

Pie charts 🍕 show the balance of organic vs. recyclable waste in the dataset.
Bar charts 📊 for quick counts.
Confusion matrices 🔍 to understand where the model gets it right (and wrong).
Bubble charts, area charts, tree maps, and more for fun and clarity.
How to Run This Project
Here’s how you can join in:

Step 1: Clone This Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/waste-classification.git  
cd waste-classification  
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure Python is installed on your machine. Then, install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
Step 3: Add the Dataset
Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it inside a folder named dataset in the root directory. It should look like this:


dataset/  
│  
├── TRAIN/  
│   ├── Organic/  
│   └── Recyclable/  
│  
└── TEST/  
    ├── Organic/  
    └── Recyclable/  
Step 4: Train the Model
Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and see the results:

python waste_classification.py  
What You’ll See
A trained model saved as waste_classification_model.h5.
Visualizations galore: Pie charts, bar graphs, tree maps, confusion matrices—you name it.
Accuracy plots that show how well the model learns.
A confusion matrix heatmap that reveals where the model shines and where it struggles.
What’s Next?
This is just the start! Here’s what could come next:

Add more categories (hazardous waste? textiles? 🚧).
Improve the model with transfer learning (using something like ResNet or MobileNet).
Deploy the model as a web app where you can upload a photo of waste and get instant feedback!
Why Contribute?
This project is open source, and I’d love your help to make it better! Whether it’s cleaning up the code, improving accuracy, or suggesting cool new ideas, your contributions are welcome.
